    "* Clone the class github repository to your computer, the one at https://github.com/gtrichards/PHYS_T480_F18/  (should already have done this).\n",
    "* Click the Github Classroom link you received via the mailing list. This will create a private github repository through which you'll be submitting your homeworks. Clone that repository to your computer.\n",
    "* Copy this notebook from the class github repository to your private homework submission repository. IMPORTANT: rename it to `<filename>-FirstLast.ipynb` once you copy it, where `<filename>` is the existing filename and `FirstLast` are your first and last name. Example: `PHYST480-F18-HW1-GordonRichards.ipynb`.\n",
