    "Repeat the simple MLE example from class (Inference2.ipynb), but with 2 changes.  First allow for a variable number of data points (and show for `N=3` and `N=10`.  Second, limit the range of valid solutions for $\\mu$ to $\\mu>1.1$ (just for `N=10`).  How does that affect your results?  Use a random seed of 42 for all.\n",

    "Produce the \"trace\" plot for the clear/cloudy day problem from Inference2.ipynb.  Then plot the histogram of that trace, throwing away steps in the trace that could be considered part of the burn-in.  Your plots should look like the ones from class (or nicer!).  Confirm that you get the same answer for day $N$ as day $N+1$ and it doesn't matter whether is was clear or cloudy on the day that you started. "
