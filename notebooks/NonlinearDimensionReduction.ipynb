    "Let's start by my echoing the brief note of caution given in Adam Miller's notebook: \"astronomers will often try to derive physical insight from PCA eigenspectra or eigentimeseries, but this is not advisable as there is no physical reason for the data to be linearly and orthogonally separable\".  Moreover, physical components are (generally) positive definite.  So, PCA is great for dimensional reduction, but for doing physics there are generally better choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "While NMF \"solves\" the issue of negative components, it is still a linear process.  For data with non-linear correlations, an entire field, known as [Manifold Learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html) and [nonlinear dimensionality reduction]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction), has been developed, with several algorithms available via the [`sklearn.manifold`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.manifold) module. \n",
